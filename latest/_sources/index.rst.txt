Welcome to PyRCA's documentation!
========================================

Introduction
############

With the rapidly growing adoption of microservices architectures, multi-service applications become the standard
paradigm in real-world IT applications. A multi-service application usually contains hundreds of interacting
services, making it harder to detect service failures and identify the root causes. Root cause analysis (RCA)
methods usually leverage the KPI metrics, traces or logs monitored on those services to determine the root causes
when a system failure is detected, helping engineers and SREs in the troubleshooting process.

PyRCA is a Python machine-learning library designed for root cause analysis, offering multiple state-of-the-art RCA
algorithms and an end-to-end pipeline for building RCA solutions. Currently, PyRCA mainly focuses on metric-based RCA
including two types of algorithms: 1. Identifying anomalous metrics in parallel with the observed anomaly via
metric data analysis, e.g., Îµ-diagnosis, and 2. Identifying root causes based a topology/causal graph representing
the causal relationships between the observed metrics, e.g., Bayesian inference, Random Walk. Besides, PyRCA
provides a convenient tool for building causal graphs from the observed time series data and domain knowledge,
helping users to develop graph-based solutions quickly. PyRCA also provides a benchmark for evaluating
various RCA methods, which is valuable for industry and academic research. We will continue improving this library
to make it more comprehensive in the future. In the future, PyRCA will support trace and log based RCA methods as well.

Installation
############

You can install :py:mod:`pyrca` from PyPI by calling ``pip install sfr-pyrca``. You may install from source by
cloning the PyRCA repo, navigating to the root directory, and calling
``pip install .``, or ``pip install -e .`` to install in editable mode. You may install additional dependencies:

- **For plotting & visualization**: Calling ``pip install sfr-pyrca[plot]``, or ``pip install .[plot]`` from the
  root directory of the repo.
- **Install all the dependencies**: Calling ``pip install sfr-pyrca[all]``, or ``pip install .[all]`` from the
  root directory of the repo.

Getting Started
###############

PyRCA provides a unified interface for training RCA models and finding root causes. To apply
a certain RCA method, you only need to specify:

- **The select RCA method**: e.g., :py:mod:`pyrca.analyzers.bayesian.BayesianNetwork`,
  :py:mod:`pyrca.analyzers.epsilon_diagnosis.EpsilonDiagnosis`.
- **The RCA configuration**: e.g., :py:mod:`pyrca.analyzers.bayesian.BayesianNetworkConfig`,
  :py:mod:`pyrca.analyzers.epsilon_diagnosis.EpsilonDiagnosisConfig`.
- **Time series data for initialization or training**: e.g., A time series data in a
  pandas dataframe.
- **Some detected anomalous KPI metrics**: Some RCA methods require the anomalous KPI metrics detected by
  certain anomaly detector.

Let's take ``BayesianNetwork`` as an example. Suppose that ``graph_df`` is a pandas dataframe of
the graph representing causal relationships between metrics (how to construct such causal graph
will be discussed later), and ``df`` is a pandas dataframe containing the historical observed time series
data (e.g., the index is the timestamp and each column represents one monitored metric). To train a
``BayesianNetwork``, you can simply run the following code:

.. code-block:: python

   from pyrca.analyzers.bayesian import BayesianNetwork
   model = BayesianNetwork(config=BayesianNetwork.config_class(graph=graph_df))
   model.train(df)
   model.save("model_folder")

After the model is trained, you can use it to find root causes of an incident given a list of anomalous
metrics detected by a certain anomaly detector, e.g.,

.. code-block:: python

   from pyrca.analyzers.bayesian import BayesianNetwork
   model = BayesianNetwork.load("model_folder")
   results = model.find_root_causes(["observed_anomalous_metric", ...])
   print(results.to_dict())

For other RCA methods, you can write similar code as above for finding root causes. For example, if you want
to try ``EpsilonDiagnosis``, you can initalize ``EpsilonDiagnosis`` as follows:

.. code-block:: python

   from pyrca.analyzers.epsilon_diagnosis import EpsilonDiagnosis
   model = EpsilonDiagnosis(config=EpsilonDiagnosis.config_class(alpha=0.01))
   model.train(normal_data)

Here ``normal_data`` is the historically observed time series data without anomalies. To find root causes,
you can run:

.. code-block:: python

   results = model.find_root_causes(abnormal_data)
   print(results.to_dict())

where ``abnormal_data`` is the time series data in an incident window.

As mentioned above, some RCA methods such as ``BayesianNetwork`` require causal graphs as their inputs. To construct such causal
graphs from the observed time series data, you can utilize our tool by running ``python -m pyrca.tools``.
This command will launch a Dash app for time series data analysis and causal discovery.

.. image:: _static/dashboard.png

The dashboard allows you to try different causal discovery methods, adjust causal discovery parameters,
add domain knowledge constraints (e.g., root/leaf nodes, forbidden/required links), and visualize
the generated causal graphs. It makes easier for manually revising causal graphs based on domain knowledge.
You can download the graph generated by this tool if you satisfy with it. The graph can be used by the RCA
methods supported in PyRCA.

Instead of using this dashboard, you can also write code for building such graphs. The package
``pyrca.graphs.causal`` includes several popular causal discovery methods you can use. All of these methods
support domain knowledge constraints. Suppose ``df`` is the observed time series data
and you want to apply the PC algorithm for building causal graphs, then the following code will help:

.. code-block:: python

   from pyrca.graphs.causal.pc import PC
   model = PC(PC.config_class())
   graph_df = model.train(df)

If you have some domain knowledge constraints, you may run:

.. code-block:: python

   from pyrca.graphs.causal.pc import PC
   model = PC(PC.config_class(domain_knowledge_file="file_path"))
   graph_df = model.train(df)

The domain knowledge file has a YAML format, e.g.,

.. code-block:: yaml

   causal-graph:
     root-nodes: ["A", "B"]
     leaf-nodes: ["E", "F"]
     forbids:
       - ["A", "E"]
     requires:
       - ["A", "C"]

This domain knowledge file states that:

1. Metrics A and B must the root nodes,
2. Metrics E and F must be the leaf nodes,
3. There is no connection from A to E, and
4. There is a connection from A to C.

You can write your domain knowledge file based on this template for generating more reliable causal
graphs.

Library Design
##############

PyRCA has five key subpackages:

- :py:mod:`pyrca.graph`: This package contains the methods for discovering causal graphs from metric data.
- :py:mod:`pyrca.outliers`: This package contains some statistical based anomaly detectors used for detecting
  anomalous metrics. We will include more methods in this package in the future.
- :py:mod:`pyrca.analyzers`: This package contains all the supported RCA methods, e.g., Bayesian inference,
  Random walk, etc.
- :py:mod:`pyrca.tools`: This includes the dashboard tools for analyzing time series and building
  causal graphs, and the evaluation metric of RCA results.
- :py:mod:`pyrca.simulation`: This package contains the methods for simulated data generation.

The following figure demonstrates the main architecture of the library.

We welcome the contribution from the open-source community to improve the library!
Before you get started, clone this repo, run ``pip install pre-commit``, and run ``pre-commit install``
from the root directory of the repo. This will ensure all files are formatted correctly and contain
the appropriate license headers whenever you make a commit.

To add a new RCA method into the library, you may follow the steps below:
1. Create a new python script file for this RCA method in the ``pyrca/analyzers`` folder.
